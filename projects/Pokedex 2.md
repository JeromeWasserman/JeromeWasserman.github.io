This is the final project ICS211 project(and probably the last time I used Java) and one of the more interesting project that I did. It was a group of 2 people only and the entire point of this project is to create GUI design, catch pokemon, and display them on the screen. In this project I contributed on sorting and storing pokemon in the array.

The difficult part of this project comes from allowing certain objects have prominence in the code which means having pokemon objects being stored in an array. I believe that it came to a great frustration when pokemon are not being displayed on the screen correctly. This is because many of conditional statements would simply not work since many of the conditional needed some way to be triggered.

I learned a lot in this project especially when it comes to GUI design which something that I never would see in a coding class since it there are programs that can be without needing to fiddle with the code. I believe that knowing what to do in this project is what allowed this project to go from doing for a grade to a genuine accomplishment.
