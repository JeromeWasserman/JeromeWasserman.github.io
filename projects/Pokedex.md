This is a project that I did by myself during my time when I was still in ICS 111 it was a very simple project that played around with arrays. This is my first time I have ever done a big project on Java but I was excited to work on it since I am fan of pokemon.

The project played around with for loops which would keep adding more object or pokemons in the array. In other words, there will be an array filled with pokemons or objects inside.

The difficulty that I faced during this project was the fact that I forgot to limit the amount of pokemons/objects which caused me to drop from an A to a B grade! There is also the fact that bugs persisted in parts of the code like incorrect information. Another thing was the fact that debugging was

The lesson is that I should read the instructions carefully before I lose points for not limiting the amount of objects allowed in an array. But I have realized that most people like myself can get to excited about a project that they might miss a small detail.
