## Overview
The Problem: We want students to study effectively and find more ways to make studying simple and effective so it can be used to get higher grades. This also could be useful to garner new friends and contacts since a student username will be there.

The Solution: We want to create a program/app that allows students to make and organize quizzes and also send them to each other. It allows an effective way of studying and can be used for teachers as well to organize quizzes in a very short amount of time. The app will also have templates to make simple quizzes by following a simple 5 minute tutorial. It also has rules and regulations that must be followed as in no inappropriate quizzes that might be considered as plagiarism and contents that may have offensive content. To do this we have an admin page to monitor the situation.

## Approach
Once the user has been successfully logged in and verified by our systems, then they can see their profile which has their contents or folders in the profile. They can see their quizzes that they made and edit it as they wish and also report any inappropriate quizzes that violate the rules and systems.

Mockup Page Ideas:
- Landing page
- Make quiz page
- Take quiz page
- Profile page:
  - Points/Achievements
  - History/Ratings
  - List of folders/documents
- Admin page:
  - See Users profiles
  - Delete Users
  - Delete quizzes
  - Edit quizzes

## Use case ideas
- New users goes to landing page, make an account, log in, return to landing page, goes to Take Quiz page, filters by subject, picks a high rated quiz, completes quiz form, goes to Profile then History to review score on quiz and give it a rating.
- Admin goes to landing page, log in, return to landing page, goes to Quizzes, sorts by rating, deletes low rated quizzes after checking them.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, goes to Make Quiz page, completes quiz making form, goes to Profile then My Quizzes, reviews or edits created quizzes.

## Beyond the basics
- Implement saving contents of the users such as quizzes and folders.
- Allowing students to email other students
- Allow to rate quizzes
- Achievements and milestones rewards
- Admin user deleting/editing certain files or even users
