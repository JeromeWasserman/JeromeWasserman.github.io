<p>The entire semester was a big uphill battle that seem to never end. But at the same time there was something that made me push forward no matter what. This journey was not done by myself but also many of my peers who had the same battles and it was satisfying to also understand what push them forward. Agile Project Management made many issues that we had during our project seem simple and interesting. It always seem to focus on flexibility rather than a direction. It pushed people to improvise and adapt to their current situation. But it left many of us wandering about and many people could share the same sentiments. Maybe in the future there could be a far more robust form of management that will not leave many of us wandering in the blistering cold. I would hesitate on the use of this technique since it does not allow many of us to work in a disciplined manner. But maybe in the future it can be used in a far more effective manner since it allows many people flexibility and whatnot.</p>

<p>Design and simply how to make it function while still making it very pleasing to eye is almost a battle between necessity and wants. In the end, necessity nor wants win but instead burning passion develops and the burning desire that cannot simply be drenched. An artist in some aspect is a perfectionist while the builder is ingenious. This combination allows me to understand that idea during our project. Design patterns are finding solutions which can be repeated in a effective manner. Maybe reinventing the wheel does not sound so bad after all, right? I never would imagined that design patterns especially pertaining to full-stack development could fulfilling but demanding. In the future it could be an interesting thought when many us in our cusp of life then we might finally realize that many perfectionists are hungry and never satisfied.</p>

<p>When you make it to the top of the mountain after the difficult journey always remember where you came from. It is easy to forget that saying when you get surrounded with so much confidence, fame, and money. Knowing where to stand in life especially in a career that have many gray areas can rather be difficult. After all, life is about making difficult choices and whatever you choose will paint who you are. People are just tabula-rasa or an empty canvas that is shaped by whatever choice that we make it to be. One needs to realize that ethics in computer science is simply just a double-edged sword. Realizing this simple fact we can surmise that knowing where to hang the mistletoe can help what truly matters for a person. For me, I realized that I simply follow orders and whatever tasks is set for me. That is what makes a good professional even though the canvas is painted with blood from the sword that I unknowingly cut myself with. After all, if you have reached the apex of the mountain you better watch your step because there is only one direction left and it is going down whether you decided it to be graceful or a hard fall is up to you.</p>

<h2 id="the-rising-sun-and-a-new-dawn---">The Rising Sun and A New Dawn . . .</h2>

<p>This course changed my perspective on life and the industry that fuels our societies. I always imagined that it would be simple because it seemed so innocent but now I realized that knowledge is simply power and knowing how to use is simply transformative. After all, the end of the road is here but the sun is rising a new dawn is calling for anyone will to continue. Therefore, it is wise to move disciplined and purpose on the path. This will decide what a person’s worth in life is and what they aspirations will be. Simply, I will continue on the path until I realize that it was simply the adventure and the difficulty that kept me going. In the end, all of the stories that I could and help people who are in their point of life where they feel aimless and I aim to make them have a direction again.</p>
