## What I want and expect
Software engineering is creating and practicing the art of creating which can mean overall satisfaction when certain things go one's way. I want to create profile that would looked good infront of my employers that could land a me a job. To learn about what the employers want is a step that needs to make sense since it can be a difference between a good review or a bad one. In this class, I was hoping to learn a skillset that can be useful or beneficial in many career fields and not just limited to Software Engineering. 

Before I was an eletrical engineer major that wanted to get a degree a job but I found the many things in EE was boring and difficult. Then I took an ICS course during the summer and continued to enjoy it since I loved creating things. It is very refreshing to have actual fun in a course since many courses was not as interesting or have practically outside the industry. This I also exaggerate my for video games and want to be game developer in the near future since creating games is very niche talent. From what I have heard C++ is the way to go for video game development.

I have doubts about this course and aspirations on becoming a game developer but rather than living in doubts about the future, I will try to my hardest in this course. In the end, I want to have skillsets that will be relevant in many fields and allow to me to be versatile.
