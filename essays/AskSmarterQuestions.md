## To ask or to not ask...

What makes a good question? Is it the expectation? Or is there something else that makes us answer or not answer question. I believe as a student I have asked questions but always felt very insecure whether people understand or even cared to answer it. Some TA's that I have talked to and asked question have ignored my questions and rather felt like I was ignored. But, I got that feeling that they did not mean it that way but rather they want to figure it out myself. Especially, when I had literally no clue on how to do start the assignment since many TA's have tight lip on these stuff. 

## A good question that explains itself and not fishing for answers...

This is an intance where a question is simply not fishing for answers. The question is about how sorting brings the data into a cache. He/she asked whether processing a sorted array is faster than processing an unsorted array and also asked about the general processes of this code. The problem is very easy to read with no misdirection or without needing to double guess. It is very concise and straight to the point and explain what he want to achieve with the question. That is why he got a very good answer in the site since the answer was explained very well and it was simply just getting the answer but at the same time it was also learning new concepts. The answer was clear and conise and it answered both of the questions.

## A question that no one asked for...

This question is a horrible and misleading question that fishes for answers and barely introduce the question. To put this into perspective, if someone told you to wash the dishes and leaving out the water, dishsoap, and more. Then it would be something close to this question. This question prints an output value that returns a string rather than an integer. The comments from the code are almost non-existant and pretty difficult to understand without prior context. This question is simply as give me the answer rather than finding it out on his own and this achieved literally nothing.
