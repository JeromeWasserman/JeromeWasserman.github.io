## A world built with patterns and how to find them . . .

Design patterns are not as simple as finding the fibonacci sequence or whatnot. But rather, it is part of us and we are made of patterns that most people would be to afraid to ask. One should ever wonder why people have rhythms like going to bed at night or performing task in the same manner for many years. In the modern age where technology is a major part of our lives we can just imagine the questions and difficulties that we will face. In this fashion, we develop solutions that can be applied to these problems in a way that they can be implemented repeatedly. This is what we call a design pattern where designs that can be implemented repeatedly without a small sliver of failure. It is meant to be a "tried and tested method" but it should not be confused for being a catch all term since designs are always evolving as we humans are. In the end, we can imagine that solutions will be driven by what is efficient and applying such effectiveness to another level.

## Alice in Uncertainland . . .

It is not to clear or obvious how to identify patterns and certainly it did not help Alice the moment she landed in a land so mystical and whimsical that anything in that land defies all logic. But it does help that she understood what needed to be done and the problem that needed to be solve. She understood that this world is different or otherwordly but realizes that many things tend to have patterns and can be have solutions. In a way, it is very similar during the course where there were many uncertainties. During the semester, the design pattern for a project that I and my teammates have been working on was difficult to say at least. Our team needed time to understand the template since it is simply not a walk in the park because of many complications. Despite this, we found a way to conquer our uncertainty and move on to get things done while learning about these new environment.
